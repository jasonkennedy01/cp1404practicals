# Jason Kennedy's CP1404 Practicals

## Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

A repository that contains the completed programs from the CP1404(Programming 2) practicals.
I am a first year IT student at JCU.
These are some things I have learned about clean code:

- Good naming (variables, constants, functions and classes)
- Using the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle
- Using the right tool for the job (like correct if, elif, else statements)
