# Line one produced a integer in between 5 and 20, 5 is the smallest value and 20 was the largest
# Line two produced a integer in between 3 and 10 in increments of 2, 3 was the smallest 9 was the largest, could not
# have produced 4 as it is not an increment of 2 from 3
# Line Three produced a floating number between 2.5 and 5.5, the smallest would have been 2.5 and the largest 5.5
